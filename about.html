    <h1>About Color Theory</h1>

    <h2>Quick catch-up on color theory</h2>
    <p>
      Hues, tints, tones, shades—what's the difference, and why does it matter?
      Let's elaborate on some of these to understand how to make a monochromatic
      color palette.
    </p>
    Want an in-depth understanding of how colors work together? Learn more in
    our comprehensive color theory guide. Hue The hue means the color, what we
    would typically call "red," "blue," "yellow," etc. In a rainbow, each
    distinct color is a different hue. Painters understand “hue” as the purest
    form of a pigment when dealing with paint color—the base color before it’s
    altered by white, black, or gray. In RGB or Hex color spaces, a hue is
    determined by the dominant wavelength of a color. In RGB, hues are
    represented by the combination of Red, Green, and Blue values, while in Hex,
    they're represented by a six-digit color code. Tint Pastels are tints. Tints
    are created by adding white to a hue. This process lightens the color,
    making it less intense and softer to the eye. In RGB, adding a tint involves
    increasing the values of Red, Green, and Blue towards 255 (the maximum in an
    8-bit color space), while in Hex, it requires moving the color code toward
    "#FFFFFF" (white). Shade A shade is the result of adding black to a hue.
    This darkens the color, making it deeper and more intense. In RGB, shading
    is achieved by reducing the values of Red, Green, and Blue, moving towards 0
    (black). In Hex, it involves moving the color code toward "#000000" (black).
    Tone Refers to a color’s vibrance. A tone is produced by adding gray (a
    mixture of equal amounts of black and white) to a hue. This process reduces
    the color's intensity or saturation, creating a more subdued and less
    vibrant color. Creating a tone in RGB and Hex color spaces involves adding
    and subtracting color values—adding white and subtracting black values to
    the base hue. These modifications to the base hue—creating tints, shades,
    and tones—are the building blocks of a monochromatic color scheme.

    <p>
      When working with RGB and Hex colors, remember that they're digital color
      spaces designed for screens. Colors in these spaces are generated by
      light, and the mixing model is additive—meaning that the more color you
      add, the closer you get to white light. By understanding and manipulating
      these elements, you can create a variety of harmonious colors from a
      single hue, giving depth, dimension, and contrast to your monochromatic
      designs.
