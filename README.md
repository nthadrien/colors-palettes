# Color Picker
This projet is meant to build an Enterpise design building tool

## Purpose
The Color Picker is designed to be a powerful and user-friendly tool that exceeds the capabilities of Adobe Colors. It allow users to easily select, explore, and generate a wide range of color palettes and harmonies. With its intuitive interface and advanced color manipulation features, our application empowers designers, artists, and anyone who needs to work with colors with greater efficiency and creativity.

## Features
1. **Intuitive Color Selection**: Our Color Picker provides an interactive color wheel and sliders for easy color selection and adjustment.
2. **Color Harmony Generation**: Easily generate harmonious color schemes based on various color harmony rules, including complementary, analogous, triadic, and more.
3. **Color Variation**: Utilize the parabolic equation \[y = a(x^2) + bx + c\] to generate a range of color variations from a selected base color.
4. **Color Palettes**: Create, save, and share custom color palettes for your projects.
5. **Color Conversion**: Convert between different color modes (RGB, HSL, HEX, etc.) with a single click.
6. **Real-time Preview**: See the color changes reflected in a live preview, allowing you to make informed decisions.
7. **Accessibility**: Ensure your color choices are accessible by providing contrast ratio information and guidelines.

## Usage
1. **Color Selection**: Click and drag on the color wheel to select your desired base color. Adjust the sliders to fine-tune the hue, saturation, and lightness.
2. **Color Harmony**: Choose from the available color harmony options (complementary, analogous, triadic, etc.) to generate a harmonious color palette.
3. **Color Variation**: Modify the parabolic equation parameters (a, b, c) to adjust the range and distribution of color variations.
4. **Color Palette Management**: Create, save, and share your custom color palettes for future use.
5. **Color Conversion**: Easily convert between different color modes (RGB, HSL, HEX, etc.) using the provided tools.
6. **Accessibility**: Refer to the contrast ratio information to ensure your color choices meet accessibility standards.
